“Engineering students are now focusing on emerging fields like Aerospace, Biomedical, Medical Electronics”</p>

 

 

<h1> Is Information Technology the most lucrative field?</h1>

<p>“With the world going hi-tech, the increasing demand for IT professionals is justifiable, and being one of the well-paid sectors, it’s true that there is a trend of engineering students choosing the IT stream,” observes Saumen Bhattacharjee, Head Talent Acquisition at GE India Technology Center in Bangalore. “However, engineering students are now focusing on emerging fields like Aerospace, Biomedical, Medical Electronics, Structural Engineering, Telecommunications, also lucrative options , to name a few,” he elaborates.

 
</p>
 

<h1> What about other fields of engineering?</h1>

<p>Shekhar Sanyal – Country Head – The IET India (UK-based engineering association with 53 student chapters in India), says that core engineering subjects will be in high demand as always but the application will constantly evolve. “IT will become embedded in all core functions and will enable the core functions to become much more effective,” he shares. For instance, GE India Technology Center hires engineers from Aerospace, Mechanical, Electronics, Electrical and Computer Science streams. Students have also started looking back at what they call core engineering jobs, that is to say “work in shop floor”, feels Micheal Baymiller, Director - HR at International Paper, a global leader in packaging and paper. IP’s India plant hires for a wide range of positions, from Mechanical Maintenance, Civil and Electrical, to Process In- charge, Paper machine and Chemical. “It comes with its own set of challenges as students’ tenacity levels in terms of sticking to a job has drastically come down,”observes Micheal.

<h1>Many students pose a question: how much will I earn in my first job?</h1>

<p>According to assessment and talent evaluation company, Aspiring Minds, salary structures vary largely across sectors. Engineering students gainfully employed in the IT services sector earn somewhere between Rs. 2.5 to 4.5 lakh per annum in their first job. In the IT product sector requiring core technology skills, salaries range from 6 to 12 lakh per year. Today, a variety of roles open for entry-level engineers in technical support and services, infrastructure management, data entry etc where salaries range from 1 lakh to 2.5 lakh per annum. “It depends on the student’s competence as to how much will he or she be able to secure in terms of monetary compensation initially,” shares Himanshu Aggarwal, CEO, Aspiring Minds.

<h1>What is this new buzz about data analytics?</h1>

<p>According to Rajita Singh, Head – HR, Broadridge Financial Solutions, data analytics is also an up and coming area. “It deals not only with collecting, gathering, analysing the data but also making sense of the data and making the recommendations,” she explains. With the vast amount of data that is available now for us, computer programming has become essential and this has meant engineers are much in demand for data analytics. Engineers have a strong base of Math, Statistics, Data Representation and these elements integrated with programming gives them an advantage over pure statisticians. Having said that, successful data analysts are those who can understand what the data represents and make meaning of the analysis. “Engineering helps but as with anything the strongest need for successful Data analytics is commonsense,” she adds! (Students, don’t miss our extensive career review on Data Analytics in this issue).

“The core engineering subjects will always remain at the heart of engineering practice, However, the practice of engineering will adapt to embed convergence of disciplines, and IT within itself”

<h1> I’m told an engineering degree is not enough, we need soft skills, too. Why is this?</h1>

<p>In 2011, the World Bank did an extensive survey to find out what skills employers seek in fresh engineering graduates. The survey found that employers perceive soft skills to be very important, and in particular communication seemed to be one of the most demanded skills by the employers. Thus it  is not surprising that during campus placements, in many cases, English language proficiency is tested first, followed by group discussions, and then technical competency. As a result many students, especially from rural regions, lose out to a smooth communicator despite possessing sound technical knowledge. Why are English language skills so important so many years after independence from the Brits?   ”We are a Global In-House Centre (GICs),” explains Vipul Singh, VP & Head of HR at ADP Private Limited. “So we have strong interactions with the business units in the US,” he explains.

Similarly, Paypal India’s GIC has 2,300 technologists, one of PayPal’s largest technology sites in the world. “We must be able to share our ideas and thought processes with people through multiple formats,” advises Anupam Pahuja, CEO of PayPal India. Both stress the need for soft skills as follows. Vipul qualifies basic English speaking as a soft skill. “It doesn’t come naturally to many whose mother tongue isn’t English. This is level 1. Level 2 is ability to comprehend what is expected by listening and Level 3 is to present the point of view, which is good, bad and ugly, to the business,” he shares.

<h1> Can I get a job after my degree?</h1>

<p>While institutes try to attract recruiters to your campus, the ultimate responsibility for ensuring you get a job is yours, advises Shantanu Paul, MD and CEO of Talentsprint. “While you are in college you should start reading up about companies, and talk to friends and family who may be able to help you understand what companies look for in new hires,” says Shantanu. It is especially important for those who don’t get into the best colleagues to differentiate yourself from your peers, so your résumé stands out in on and off campus interviews. Shantanu suggests some ways - writing a blog, taking on a project, working as an intern at a company or taking courses where you can improve your technology skills and possibly get a certification that is recognised by the industry.

<h1>TYPES OF ENGINEERING</h1>

<h1>Aerospace Engineer </h1>
<p>Aerospace engineering is the study of the design, development, and production of air and spacecraft. This engineering discipline is often divided between those who pursue careers on the aeronautical side and those working on space craft. Both air and space vehicles contain complex subsystems that require specialists from many engineering groups such as electrical, mechanical, and computer engineering 
</p>
<h1>Agricultural Engineer </h1>
<p>Agricultural engineering is also known as biological engineering, and it covers subjects from aquaculture (raising food sources that thrive in water), to land farming and forestry. These engineers also develop biofuels, plan animal environments, and find better food processing methods. Often they work in offices, but they are also outdoors and traveling to worksites where they oversee equipment function in agricultural settings, and assure that government regulations are met. 
</p>
<h1>Automotive Engineer</h1> 
<p>Automotive engineering is one of the most exciting, challenging and rewarding careers. Whenever a customer drives a new vehicle off a dealership lot, he or she is taking with them the technical expertise of many engineers, but in particular, the automotive engineer. Automotive engineers research, design and develop vehicles and their subsystems. They work with sophisticated technologies to create products that thrill the senses and bring the freedom of mobility to the world. 
</p>
<h1>Computer Engineer</h1> 
<p>Computer Engineers develop and improve the software programs and hardware that make computers run. Computer Engineers may specialize in either software or hardware. From operating system software, such as Windows and Linux, to individual computer programs, such as Photoshop and Microsoft Office, Software Engineers turn piles of hardware into fully functional computers. Hardware Engineers develop the hardware of computers, including the motherboards, graphics and audio cards and drives that are later programmed by Software Engineers 
</p>
<h1>Electrical Engineer</h1> 
<p>Electrical engineers specialize in power supply and generation. They design, develop, test and supervise electrical equipment manufacturing. They have also been trained to handle responsibilities like wiring and lighting installations in buildings, automobiles and aircraft. What is great about being an electrical engineer is that the training is so extensive that graduates may land a job in many different industries such as construction, manufacturing and design. 
</p>
<h1>Mechanical Engineer</h1> 
<p>Mechanical engineering is the study of motion, energy and force. The mechanical engineer seeks to control these elements by using a combination of material, human and economic resources to develop mechanical solutions that help satisfy the needs and wants of society. 
</p>
<h1>Software Engineer</h1> 
<p>Software engineers are specialists who are in charge of the testing, design, development and maintenance of computer software for business and personal use. They apply the principles of mathematics, engineering and computer science in creating managing software. These professionals are responsible for programming computers to make them operate as they should
